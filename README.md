# askfm
first oop project with c++.

I tried to use some of topics of oop.

**How to ask question ?** 

you can do that by show id of all Users first from *show all user in the system* then choose *Ask question*.

**How to answer ?**

steps Like ask question except that you will chose *Answer Question*.

**NOTE**

- The project still need alot of exceptions handling.

- Username is unique in the system.

- password is string

- all id is string 

## I will be thankful to U if you do that:
1. you can tell me what precent of using opp in the project.
2. tell me about any bugs that may be face you during testing .
3. suggest features with some hint to do it(prefered).
